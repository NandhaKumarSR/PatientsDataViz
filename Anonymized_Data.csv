-Trial of plain GABA in the evening. Would track seizure frequency and length. Would also track if exercised the day before as the natural
endorphins may have some calming factors. 
If GABA is helpful, can add a dose in the am. [PERSONALNAME] is a blend that has other calming herbals that we can also look at.
If GABA not helpful, may consider medicinal grade CBD
-Will order ambulatory EEG (72 hour ideally) to capture the am sleep/wake routine
2) Thyroid:
-Continue 75mcg dose for now
-Would like additional labs to make sure the thiamine and selenium and some other factors are also good. We will share the order.
3) Menstrual cycle:
-Since no severe cramping, will wait on OCPs
-Would set a reminder/alarm every 2 hours for the [DATE] days of the cycle to just have a restroom/pad check. May also look at the class schedule and set a routine for bathroom break when at school",

Rhinosinusitis, or more commonly sinusitis, is the medical term for inflammation (swelling) of the lining of the sinuses and nose. The sinuses are the hollow areas within the facial bones that are connected to the nasal openings. The sinuses are lined with mucous membranes, similar to the inside of the nose.
There are two main types of sinusitis: acute and chronic. Acute sinusitis is inflammation that lasts for less than 4 weeks, subacute sinusitis lasts from 4 to 12 weeks, while chronic sinusitis lasts for more than 12 weeks. Acute sinusitis is common.
ACUTE SINUSITIS CAUSES
The most common cause of acute sinusitis is a viral infection associated with the common cold. This condition is also called viral sinusitis. Bacterial sinusitis occurs much less commonly, in only 0.5 to 2 percent of cases, usually as a complication of viral sinusitis.
Because antibiotics are effective only against bacterial, and not viral, infections, most people with acute sinusitis do not need antibiotics and would be putting themselves at risk for medication side effects and for developing antibiotic resistance by taking them for nonbacterial sinusitis.
ACUTE SINUSITIS SYMPTOMS
Symptoms of acute sinusitis include:
Thick, yellow to green discharge from the nose
Nasal congestion or blockage
Facial pain, pressure, or fullness
Other acute sinusitis symptoms can include fever (temperature greater than [ALPHANUMERICID] or 38C), fatigue, cough, difficulty or inability to smell, ear pressure or fullness, headache, and bad breath. In most cases, these symptoms develop over the course of one day and begin to improve by 7 to 10 days.
DO I HAVE VIRAL OR BACTERIAL SINUSITIS?
It is difficult to know if you have a viral or bacterial sinus infection initially. Studies show that duration of symptoms cannot always be used to distinguish between viral and bacterial sinusitis, even when lasting longer than 7 to 10 days.
If symptoms of sinusitis last more than 10 days, or if you have symptoms that initially improve but then worsen again within the first 7 days ( "" double-worsening "" ), you may have bacterial sinusitis.
DO I NEED TO BE EXAMINED?
If you have one or more of the following symptoms, you should seek medical attention immediately (even if symptoms have been present for less than seven days):
Persistent high fever (>102F)
Sudden, severe pain in the face or head
Double vision or difficulty seeing
Confusion or difficulty thinking clearly
Swelling or redness around one or both eyes
Stiff neck
You may also want to see a healthcare provider if you have symptoms that last more than 10 days or for symptoms that initially improve and worsen again.
ACUTE SINUSITIS TREATMENT
Treatment for sinusitis involves symptom relief and [DATE] or [DATE] not include antibiotic therapy. You should speak with your healthcare provider about whether or not you need antibiotic therapy. Whether the sinusitis is bacterial or viral, it can often improve with non-antibiotic treatment, although bacterial sinusitis can also worsen and require antibiotic treatment.
Symptomatic treatment  Symptomatic treatment of a sinus infection aims to relieve symptoms. These treatments do not shorten the duration of illness.
Pain relief  Nonprescription pain medications, such as acetaminophen (eg, Tylenol) or ibuprofen (eg, Motrin, Advil), are recommended for pain.
Nasal irrigation  Flushing the nose and sinuses with a saline solution several times per day has been proven to decrease pain associated with congestion and shorten the duration of symptoms. Instructions for nasal irrigation are provided in the table (table 1).
Nasal steroids  Nasal steroids (steroids delivered by a nasal spray) can help to reduce swelling inside the nose, usually within two to three days. These drugs have few side effects and relieve symptoms in most people.
There are a number of nasal steroids available by prescription, and one (triamcinolone or Nasacort) is available without a prescription. These drugs are all effective but differ in how frequently they must be used and how much they cost.
Other treatments
Oral decongestants  Oral decongestants (most commonly pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine) may be helpful if you have associated symptoms of ear pain or fullness.
Nasal decongestant sprays  Nasal decongestant sprays, including oxymetazoline (Afrin) and phenylephrine (Neo-Synephrine), can be used to temporarily treat congestion. However, these sprays should not be used for more than two to three days due to the risk of rebound congestion (when the nose becomes congested constantly unless the medication is used repeatedly), possible addiction, and long-term consequences of frequent use, including persistent nasal dryness and crusting, which is very difficult to treat once it has developed.
Oral antihistamines  Oral antihistamines (such as diphenhydramine/Benadryl) are not proven to improve symptoms of sinusitis and can have unwanted side effects.
Mucolytics  Medications to thin secretions (such as guaifenesin) may help to clear mucus.
Observation  Observation (continuing to watch and wait) is an option for treatment for many patients. You should speak with your healthcare provider about whether or not this is the best option for you.
Watching and waiting is a reasonable option because up to 75 percent of people with bacterial sinusitis improve within one month without antibiotics. During the watch and wait period, treatments to improve symptoms are recommended. If symptoms worsen with observation, treatment with an antibiotic is usually started. (See 'Symptomatic treatment' above.)
Antibiotics  Bacterial sinusitis does not always need to be treated with antibiotics, as many patients improve without antibiotics. You should speak with your healthcare provider about whether or not you need antibiotics. Patients who have worsening symptoms after being managed with watchful waiting are usually started on antibiotics. Treatments to relieve symptoms are also recommended during antibiotic treatment. 
One of the least expensive and most effective antibiotics for sinusitis is amoxicillin. An alternate antibiotic will be prescribed if you are allergic to penicillin or if you live in an area where resistance to that particular antibiotic is high. Regardless of which antibiotic is prescribed, it is important to follow the dosing instructions carefully and to finish the entire course of treatment. Taking the medication less often than prescribed or stopping the medication early can lead to complications, such as a recurrent infection.
What if I do not improve with treatment?  If you do not improve or if you worsen after a course of antibiotics, you should be re-examined. You may need a different antibiotic or further evaluation with imaging or an exam of the inside of the sinuses.
In some cases, symptoms of sinusitis improve but then recur. This is usually because the infection was not completely eliminated by the antibiotic. An alternate antibiotic, extended antibiotic treatment, and/or further testing may be recommended, depending upon your individual situation."

A strep infection is the most important of the several causes of sore throat. A strep throat is caused by a certain strain of Streptococcus bacteria. Some times a high fever accompanies the infection, but not always. Other features of strep throat are redness in the throat, with or without white spots; a fine, sandpaper-like, pink skin rash; weakness; headache; and abdominal pain and other aches and pains.
How can I tell if a sore throat is strep throat?
Sometimes a severe strep infection is easy to diagnose, but other times it isnt. Throat cultures and other lab tests can be very helpful in telling the difference between strep and viral infections.
[PERSONALNAME] antibiotics help?
If your sore throat is caused by strep, yes. Penicillin or another appropriate antibiotic almost always takes care of the problem if the antibiotic is taken for a full 10 days. Sometimes an injection of long-acting penicillin is given instead.
But never use an antibiotic that has been prescribed for somebody else. You could be allergic to it, and if you take it before you are checked by a doctor, it may interfere with a throat culture or other tests.
What if strop throat is not properly treated?
After an untreated or partially treated strep throat is gone and almost forgotten, rheumatic fever may occur. Rheumatic fever is a serious, complex illness that may include various combinations of fever, weakness, swollen joints, a strange-looking rash, and sometimes damage to a heart valve.
Although rheumatic fever doesnt always occur when strep is missed or inadequately treated, sometimes it does. It is not worth taking a chance. Even though an antibiotic may help you feel better right away, its important to take a full 10-day prescription.
Is strep throat contagious?
Yes. Be considerate of other people so you don give strep to them. If you have strep throat, you should stay home and away from others until your symptoms are gone and you have taken your antibiotic for atleast a couple of days.
Be sure to call your doctor about any unexpected problems."

Cluster Headache 
General Information: Cluster headaches may occur over several weeks or months, and even years. They occur in groups and more often in the spring and fall. These headaches usually last between 30 minutes and two hours. During your headache you may feel the need to pace or rock while holding your head at the site of pain. When the attack is over, you may have a feeling of relief. The attacks may occur several times a day or at night and may suddenly disappear. This is a chronic disease that tends to worsen year after year. These headaches most often affect middle-aged males.
Instructions:
1. You have been given medication and will need to be driven home by a responsible friend or relative.
2. If your doctor has prescribed any medicine, take only as directed.
3. Some medications may prevent cluster headaches. You may want to discuss these with your doctor.
4. An attack may be triggered by:
a. Smoking or drinking alcohol.
b. Napping in the daytime.
c. Breathing in solvents, gasoline or oil-based paints for long periods of time.
d. Traveling to high altitude areas (above 5,000 feet) or in airplanes.
5. Taking medication recommended by your doctor before airplane travel may help prevent an attack. Using oxygen during airplane travel may help relieve a headache.
6. Supervised exercise may help. Talk to your doctor about exercises before starting.

Cluster Headache 
General Information: Cluster headaches may occur over several weeks or months, and even years. They occur in groups and more often in the spring and fall. These headaches usually last between 30 minutes and two hours. During your headache you may feel the need to pace or rock while holding your head at the site of pain. When the attack is over, you may have a feeling of relief. The attacks may occur several times a day or at night and may suddenly disappear. This is a chronic disease that tends to worsen year after year. These headaches most often affect middle-aged males.
Instructions:
1. You have been given medication and will need to be driven home by a responsible friend or relative.
2. If your doctor has prescribed any medicine, take only as directed.
3. Some medications may prevent cluster headaches. You may want to discuss these with your doctor.
4. An attack may be triggered by:
a. Smoking or drinking alcohol.
b. Napping in the daytime.
c. Breathing in solvents, gasoline or oil-based paints for long periods of time.
d. Traveling to high altitude areas (above 5,000 feet) or in airplanes.
5. Taking medication recommended by your doctor before airplane travel may help prevent an attack. Using oxygen during airplane travel may help relieve a headache.
6. Supervised exercise may help. Talk to your doctor about exercises before starting.
7. Biofeedback programs may help reduce the pain. Talk to your doctor about this type of program.

Cluster Headache 
General Information: Cluster headaches may occur over several weeks or months, and even years. They occur in groups and more often in the spring and fall. These headaches usually last between 30 minutes and two hours. During your headache you may feel the need to pace or rock while holding your head at the site of pain. When the attack is over, you may have a feeling of relief. The attacks may occur several times a day or at night and may suddenly disappear. This is a chronic disease that tends to worsen year after year. These headaches most often affect middle-aged males.
Instructions:
1. You have been given medication and will need to be driven home by a responsible friend or relative.
2. If your doctor has prescribed any medicine, take only as directed.
3. Some medications may prevent cluster headaches. You may want to discuss these with your doctor.
4. An attack may be triggered by:
a. Smoking or drinking alcohol.
b. Napping in the daytime.
c. Breathing in solvents, gasoline or oil-based paints for long periods of time.
d. Traveling to high altitude areas (above 5,000 feet) or in airplanes.
5. Taking medication recommended by your doctor before airplane travel may help prevent an attack. Using oxygen during airplane travel may help relieve a headache.

General Information: [PERSONALNAME] is an inflammation of the stomach and intestines that causes diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramping. It can be brought on by an infection, certain drugs or foods, or intestinal diseases. Many cases are due to a viral infection (stomach flu). Another common cause is eating or drinking food or water that contains harmful germs. The most serious problem is loss of body water from repeated bouts of diarrhea (dehydration).
Instructions:
1. Rest in bed until you feel better or the diarrhea and vomiting are gone.
2. The main treatment is to replace lost body fluids to keep you from becoming dehydrated.
a. If you have vomiting and cant keep fluids down, suck on ice chips until the vomiting stops. Slowly 
drink more fluids as vomiting stops.
b. While you are passing watery stools, drink plenty of fluids and eat saltine crackers. Drink some fluid 
every 30 minutes until you pass pale-colored urine. You may need to drink two to three quarts of 
fluid a day before this happens.
c. This safest and most easily tolerated fluid, especially at first, is a premixed oral rehydration solution. 
You can buy it at a drug, grocery, or discount store. Follow the directions on the label.
d. Other good choices are clear fluids such as certain fruit juices, caffeine-free soft drinks, tea, sports 
drinks and flavored mineral water. Avoid prune, apple and grape juice because these may make your 
diarrhea worse.
e. Avoid milk and other dairy products for the first two or three days.
3. Dont start eating solid foods (besides crackers) until your stools become soft. Then, you may eat easy-to digest foods such as cooked cereal, bread, tortillas, bananas, rice, baked potatoes, boiled or baked fish, and chicken. You may eat your regular foods after two or three days.
4. You may use an antidiarrhea medicine that you can buy without a prescription. Follow the directions on the label. Do NOT use this medicine if you have a high fever and bloody stools.
5. If you were given a prescription for an antibiotic, take it as ordered by your doctor until it is all gone.
6. Until your diarrhea stops, stay away from others. Wash your hands with soap and water after using the toilet and before you touch food.
Call if:
1. The diarrhea lasts more than ____ hours after starting the special diet.
2. You have a temperature over ____F (____C).
3. You have mucus or pus in your stools.
Return IMMEDIATELY if:
1. You have blood in your stools.
2. You have severe pain in your abdomen or rectum.
3. You have signs of water loss (dehydration) such as dry mouth and skin, increased thirst, little or no urination, or dizziness or light-headedness."

Rhinosinusitis, or more commonly sinusitis, is the medical term for inflammation (swelling) of the lining of the sinuses and nose. The sinuses are the hollow areas within the facial bones that are connected to the nasal openings. The sinuses are lined with mucous membranes, similar to the inside of the nose.
There are two main types of sinusitis: acute and chronic. Acute sinusitis is inflammation that lasts for less than 4 weeks, subacute sinusitis lasts from 4 to 12 weeks, while chronic sinusitis lasts for more than 12 weeks. Acute sinusitis is common.
ACUTE SINUSITIS CAUSES
The most common cause of acute sinusitis is a viral infection associated with the common cold. This condition is also called viral sinusitis. Bacterial sinusitis occurs much less commonly, in only 0.5 to 2 percent of cases, usually as a complication of viral sinusitis.
Because antibiotics are effective only against bacterial, and not viral, infections, most people with acute sinusitis do not need antibiotics and would be putting themselves at risk for medication side effects and for developing antibiotic resistance by taking them for nonbacterial sinusitis.
ACUTE SINUSITIS SYMPTOMS
Symptoms of acute sinusitis include:
Thick, yellow to green discharge from the nose
Nasal congestion or blockage
Facial pain, pressure, or fullness
Other acute sinusitis symptoms can include fever (temperature greater than [ALPHANUMERICID] or 38C), fatigue, cough, difficulty or inability to smell, ear pressure or fullness, headache, and bad breath. In most cases, these symptoms develop over the course of one day and begin to improve by 7 to 10 days.
DO I HAVE VIRAL OR BACTERIAL SINUSITIS?
It is difficult to know if you have a viral or bacterial sinus infection initially. Studies show that duration of symptoms cannot always be used to distinguish between viral and bacterial sinusitis, even when lasting longer than 7 to 10 days.
If symptoms of sinusitis last more than 10 days, or if you have symptoms that initially improve but then worsen again within the first 7 days ( "" double-worsening "" ), you may have bacterial sinusitis.
DO I NEED TO BE EXAMINED?
If you have one or more of the following symptoms, you should seek medical attention immediately (even if symptoms have been present for less than seven days):
Persistent high fever (>102F)
Sudden, severe pain in the face or head
Double vision or difficulty seeing
Confusion or difficulty thinking clearly
Swelling or redness around one or both eyes
Stiff neck
You may also want to see a healthcare provider if you have symptoms that last more than 10 days or for symptoms that initially improve and worsen again.
ACUTE SINUSITIS TREATMENT
Treatment for sinusitis involves symptom relief and [DATE] or [DATE] not include antibiotic therapy. You should speak with your healthcare provider about whether or not you need antibiotic therapy. Whether the sinusitis is bacterial or viral, it can often improve with non-antibiotic treatment, although bacterial sinusitis can also worsen and require antibiotic treatment.
Symptomatic treatment  Symptomatic treatment of a sinus infection aims to relieve symptoms. These treatments do not shorten the duration of illness.
Pain relief  Nonprescription pain medications, such as acetaminophen (eg, Tylenol) or ibuprofen (eg, Motrin, Advil), are recommended for pain.
Nasal irrigation  Flushing the nose and sinuses with a saline solution several times per day has been proven to decrease pain associated with congestion and shorten the duration of symptoms. Instructions for nasal irrigation are provided in the table (table 1).
Nasal steroids  Nasal steroids (steroids delivered by a nasal spray) can help to reduce swelling inside the nose, usually within two to three days. These drugs have few side effects and relieve symptoms in most people.
There are a number of nasal steroids available by prescription, and one (triamcinolone or Nasacort) is available without a prescription. These drugs are all effective but differ in how frequently they must be used and how much they cost.
Other treatments
Oral decongestants  Oral decongestants (most commonly pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine) may be helpful if you have associated symptoms of ear pain or fullness.
Nasal decongestant sprays  Nasal decongestant sprays, including oxymetazoline (Afrin) and phenylephrine (Neo-Synephrine), can be used to temporarily treat congestion. However, these sprays should not be used for more than two to three days due to the risk of rebound congestion (when the nose becomes congested constantly unless the medication is used repeatedly), possible addiction, and long-term consequences of frequent use, including persistent nasal dryness and crusting, which is very difficult to treat once it has developed.
Oral antihistamines  Oral antihistamines (such as diphenhydramine/Benadryl) are not proven to improve symptoms of sinusitis and can have unwanted side effects.
Mucolytics  Medications to thin secretions (such as guaifenesin) may help to clear mucus.
Observation  Observation (continuing to watch and wait) is an option for treatment for many patients. You should speak with your healthcare provider about whether or not this is the best option for you.
Watching and waiting is a reasonable option because up to 75 percent of people with bacterial sinusitis improve within one month without antibiotics. During the watch and wait period, treatments to improve symptoms are recommended. If symptoms worsen with observation, treatment with an antibiotic is usually started. (See 'Symptomatic treatment' above.)
Antibiotics  Bacterial sinusitis does not always need to be treated with antibiotics, as many patients improve without antibiotics. You should speak with your healthcare provider about whether or not you need antibiotics. Patients who have worsening symptoms after being managed with watchful waiting are usually started on antibiotics. Treatments to relieve symptoms are also recommended during antibiotic treatment. 
One of the least expensive and most effective antibiotics for sinusitis is amoxicillin. An alternate antibiotic will be prescribed if you are allergic to penicillin or if you live in an area where resistance to that particular antibiotic is high. Regardless of which antibiotic is prescribed, it is important to follow the dosing instructions carefully and to finish the entire course of treatment. Taking the medication less often than prescribed or stopping the medication early can lead to complications, such as a recurrent infection.
What if I do not improve with treatment?  If you do not improve or if you worsen after a course of antibiotics, you should be re-examined. You may need a different antibiotic or further evaluation with imaging or an exam of the inside of the sinuses.
In some cases, symptoms of sinusitis improve but then recur. This is usually because the infection was not completely eliminated by the antibiotic. An alternate antibiotic, extended antibiotic treatment, and/or further testing may be recommended, depending upon your individual situation."

General Information: A low fat diet means eating foods that dont have a lot of fat in them. Cholesterol is found in animal fats, oils, egg yolk and in your body. It is also in the blood and brain tissue. Too much cholesterol in your blood may block blood flow in your blood vessels. High blood cholesterol raises your risk for heart attack, stroke or other health problems. Your diet should be low in fat to control your cholesterol. Saturated fat is fat that may raise your cholesterol. A saturated fat is solid at room temperature, such as butter, lard and coconut or palm oil.
Instructions: [PERSONALNAME], roast, boil, or broil meat, fish, or poultry. Do not fry these foods. Before cooking, remove fat from all meats and remove skin from poultry. If you buy packaged foods, choose those with less than 30 percent of calories as fat. Always buy low fat or fat free dairy products. You may eat fat free foods as often as you like. But, do not eat these foods if they have too many calories. If you buy margarine, choose one that is soft, low in fat, or made with liquid oil. Lose weight if you are overweight. Talk to your caregiver about the best weight loss plan for you.
LIST 1: Do not eat foods from this list until your care giver says it is okay. If you do eat these foods, only eat zero to four servings each month from list 1.

Low-Cholesterol Diet
General Information: Cholesterol is a type of fat found in the blood that may increase the risk of heart attack or stroke. It is important to keep the amount of cholesterol in your blood low. A low-cholesterol diet may help to lower your blood cholesterol level if it is too high. In addition, it is also important to cut back on foods that contain saturated fats. This is because the body makes cholesterol from the saturated fats you eat. Many books and pamphlets are available that list foods that contain cholesterol and saturated fats. The following list will give you a general idea of foods that you can eat and those that you should avoid.

General Information: Hypertension is high blood pressure. Many people dont know they have hypertension. You may feel fine even if your blood pressure is too high. High blood pressure is not harmless. It can cause serious problems, including strokes, heart attacks, kidney failure and even death. High blood pressure can be treated. With proper care, you can control your blood pressure and lower your chance for future problems.
Instructions:
1. Regular visits to a doctor are an important part of treatment for hypertension.
2. Your doctor has prescribed medicine to lower your blood pressure. Take it exactly as prescribed. Dont stop taking your medication or try to adjust the dosage yourself.
3. Dont take cold or sinus medicines or diet pills that you can buy without a prescription. These contain chemicals that may raise your blood pressure. You should especially avoid taking medicines that contain phenylpropanolamine.
4. If you smoke, try to quit or at least cut down as much as possible. People with hypertension who smoke have a much higher risk of developing other problems.
5. Avoid foods and drinks that are high in sodium (salt). These include smoked meats (such as ham and bacon), cheese, canned and prepared frozen foods, and butter and margarine. Read all labels carefully. Dont add salt to your food.
6. If you are overweight, choose a moderate weight loss diet and stick to it. This may help to lower your blood pressure and reduce your risk of developing other problems associated with hypertension.
7. Exercise at least three times a week. This helps reduce stress, keep your body weight normal, and reduce blood pressure. Check with your doctor before beginning a new exercise program.
8. Try to reduce your stress level. Relaxation techniques such as meditation, yoga or biofeedback may be helpful.

1. You have any problems that may be related to the medicine you are taking.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Most coronaviruses in humans are known to cause what we often refer to as the common cold. Rarely, coronaviruses can be come much more serious and have caused more serious infections such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). [ALPHANUMERICID] appears to be more serious than the routine coronaviruses that cause colds, but not as severe as MERS or SARS. What are the symptoms of Coronavirus disease 2019 ([ALPHANUMERICID])?Reported illnesses have ranged from mild symptoms to severe illness and death for confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 ([ALPHANUMERICID]) cases. The following symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure.  Fever  Cough  Shortness of breath PREVENTION: There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 ([ALPHANUMERICID]). The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. However, as a reminder, CDC always recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory diseases, including: Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Stay home when you are sick. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe .Follow CDCs recommendations for using a facemask. CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including [ALPHANUMERICID]. Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of [ALPHANUMERICID] to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty. CORONAVIRUS TESTING: IF YOU HAD A [ALPHANUMERICID] TEST TODAY: Please note test results will not be available for 7-10 days and will be shared with you on your patient portal. GENERAL GUIDANCE FOR ISOLATION & [PERSONALNAME] NOT TESTED: Individual - If ill, stay home until 72 hours after fever resolves or 7 days after illness began, whichever is longer. Close Contact- No extra measures needed. Other Precautions- No extra measures needed. TEST PENDING: Individual- Remain isolated, away from others in the home, until results come back. Close Contact- If ill, stay home. If fever-free and no symptoms, free to go about normal activities. Other Precautions- No extra measures needed. NEGATIVE TEST: Individual- If ill, stay home until 72 hours after fever resolves or 7 days after illness began, whichever is longer. Close Contact- No extra measures needed. Other Precautions- No extra measures needed. POSITIVE/CONFIRMED TEST: Individual- Remain isolated at home until 7 days after onset of symptoms or 72 hours after symptoms resolve, whichever is longer. If symptoms worsen, call provider for further evaluation. If life threatening emergency, call 911. Close Contact- If identified as a close contact, remain quarantined at home for 14 days for symptom monitoring and/or testing. Other Precautions- School, workplace or other facilities where a confirmed case has been present may need to notify students, staff, and families. If you were referred to a Covid Infusion Center please take your referral notice and present to them. When to seek emergency medical attention Look for emergency warning signs* for [ALPHANUMERICID]. If someone is showing any of these signs, seek emergency medical care immediately: Trouble breathing Persistent pain or pressure in the chest New confusion Inability to wake or stay awake Bluish lips or face *This list is not all possible symptoms. Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you. Call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility: Notify the operator that you are seeking care for someone who has or may have [ALPHANUMERICID]. [ALPHANUMERICID] RECOMMENDED SUPPLEMENTS: Vitamin C 1000 mg per/day- Ascorbic acid has many biological properties that can help the body fight viruses and bacteria. Zinc 75-110 mg/day- It is believed that zinc blocks genetic replication which can slow the spread of viruses. Zinc lozenges are preferred. Vitamin D3 1000-4000 IU per/day- Vitamin D has very powerful immune boosting properties. Vitamin D levels begin to drop in older person especially during the winter months. Melatonin (slow release) 0.3 mg increase as tolerated to 1-2 mg/night- Melatonin is a strong anti-oxidant which may slow viral reproduction. People over 40 ten to have lower levels of melatonin, Quercetin 250-500 mg/ two times per day- Quercetin comes from plants and is believed to be a very potent antiviral chemical.

General Information: A low fat diet means eating foods that dont have a lot of fat in them. Cholesterol is found in animal fats, oils, egg yolk and in your body. It is also in the blood and brain tissue. Too much cholesterol in your blood may block blood flow in your blood vessels. High blood cholesterol raises your risk for heart attack, stroke or other health problems. Your diet should be low in fat to control your cholesterol. Saturated fat is fat that may raise your cholesterol. A saturated fat is solid at room temperature, such as butter, lard and coconut or palm oil.
Instructions: [PERSONALNAME], roast, boil, or broil meat, fish, or poultry. Do not fry these foods. Before cooking, remove fat from all meats and remove skin from poultry. If you buy packaged foods, choose those with less than 30 percent of calories as fat. Always buy low fat or fat free dairy products. You may eat fat free foods as often as you like. But, do not eat these foods if they have too many calories. If you buy margarine, choose one that is soft, low in fat, or made with liquid oil. Lose weight if you are overweight. Talk to your caregiver about the best weight loss plan for you.

cont mucinex as directed",,,"Sore Throat
What causes a sore throat?
Pharyngitis (pronounced:  "" fare-en-jy-tis "" )-which is what your doctor calls a sore throat-can be caused by many things. Sometimes, when mucus from your sinuses drains into your throat, the drainage can make your throat feel sore. Viruses (such as those that cause the common cold) and bacteria (which can cause many illnesses, such as strep throat) can give you a sore throat. Your throat also may feel sore if you smoke, breathe polluted air, or drink alcoholic beverages. If you have hay fever or other allergies, a sore throat may be one of the symptoms.
How do I know what is causing my sore throat?
Many of the illnesses that cause sore throats have similar symptoms. If you have a sore throat, you can treat the pain with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen. If the soreness in your throat is still there after two days, call your doctor. He or she may need to run tests to find out the cause of your sore throat so that you can get the right treatment.
What is strep throat?
Strep throat is caused by a type of bacteria called Streptococcus (pronounced:  "" strep-toe-cok-us "" ). The pain of strep throat often feels like a sore throat caused by other illnesses. The important thing about strep throat is that you could get serious complications if it is not treated with antibiotics.
What is the treatment for a sore throat caused by bacteria?
If your sore throat is caused by strep, your doctor will probably give you an antibiotic. It is important to take all of the antibiotic, even if you start feeling better after a few days.
What is the treatment for a sore throat caused by a virus?
Antibiotics do not work against viruses. Infections caused by viruses usually just have to run their course. If you have a cold, your symptoms will usually go away within a week or 10 days. You can help yourself feel better with the tips listed in the box below.
What about a sore throat that is caused by allergies?
If a sore throat is a symptom of hay fever or another allergy, your doctor can help you find out how to avoid the things that trigger your allergy. Or, you may need to take medicine for your allergy.
How can I feel better?
Take acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen.
Gargle with warm salt water (1 teaspoon of salt in a large glass of water).
Suck on throat lozenges or hard candy.
Suck on flavored frozen desserts, such as popsicles.
Use a humidifier."

ENT: Infection control precautions, Rest and Fluids",,,"Strep Throat
A strep infection is the most important of the several causes of sore throat. A strep throat is caused by a certain strain of Streptococcus bacteria. Some times a high fever accompanies the infection, but not always. Other features of strep throat are redness in the throat, with or without white spots; a fine, sandpaper-like, pink skin rash; weakness; headache; and abdominal pain and other aches and pains.
How can I tell if a sore throat is strep throat?
Sometimes a severe strep infection is easy to diagnose, but other times it isnt. Throat cultures and other lab tests can be very helpful in telling the difference between strep and viral infections.
[PERSONALNAME] antibiotics help?
If your sore throat is caused by strep, yes. Penicillin or another appropriate antibiotic almost always takes care of the problem if the antibiotic is taken for a full 10 days. Sometimes an injection of long-acting penicillin is given instead.
But never use an antibiotic that has been prescribed for somebody else. You could be allergic to it, and if you take it before you are checked by a doctor, it may interfere with a throat culture or other tests.
What if strop throat is not properly treated?
After an untreated or partially treated strep throat is gone and almost forgotten, rheumatic fever may occur. Rheumatic fever is a serious, complex illness that may include various combinations of fever, weakness, swollen joints, a strange-looking rash, and sometimes damage to a heart valve.
Although rheumatic fever doesnt always occur when strep is missed or inadequately treated, sometimes it does. It is not worth taking a chance. Even though an antibiotic may help you feel better right away, its important to take a full 10-day prescription.
Is strep throat contagious?
Yes. Be considerate of other people so you don give strep to them. If you have strep throat, you should stay home and away from others until your symptoms are gone and you have taken your antibiotic for atleast a couple of days.
Be sure to call your doctor about any unexpected problems."

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Most coronaviruses in humans are known to cause what we often refer to as the common cold. Rarely, coronaviruses can be come much more serious and have caused more serious infections such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). [ALPHANUMERICID] appears to be more serious than the routine coronaviruses that cause colds, but not as severe as MERS or SARS. What are the symptoms of Coronavirus disease 2019 ([ALPHANUMERICID])?Reported illnesses have ranged from mild symptoms to severe illness and death for confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 ([ALPHANUMERICID]) cases. The following symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure.  Fever  Cough  Shortness of breath PREVENTION: There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 ([ALPHANUMERICID]). The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. However, as a reminder, CDC always recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory diseases, including: Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Stay home when you are sick. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe .Follow CDCs recommendations for using a facemask. CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including [ALPHANUMERICID]. Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of [ALPHANUMERICID] to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty. CORONAVIRUS TESTING: IF YOU HAD A [ALPHANUMERICID] TEST TODAY: Please note test results will not be available for 7-10 days and will be shared with you on your patient portal. GENERAL GUIDANCE FOR ISOLATION & [PERSONALNAME] NOT TESTED: Individual - If ill, stay home until 72 hours after fever resolves or 7 days after illness began, whichever is longer. Close Contact- No extra measures needed. Other Precautions- No extra measures needed. TEST PENDING: Individual- Remain isolated, away from others in the home, until results come back. Close Contact- If ill, stay home. If fever-free and no symptoms, free to go about normal activities. Other Precautions- No extra measures needed. NEGATIVE TEST: Individual- If ill, stay home until 72 hours after fever resolves or 7 days after illness began, whichever is longer. Close Contact- No extra measures needed. Other Precautions- No extra measures needed. POSITIVE/CONFIRMED TEST: Individual- Remain isolated at home until 7 days after onset of symptoms or 72 hours after symptoms resolve, whichever is longer. If symptoms worsen, call provider for further evaluation. If life threatening emergency, call 911. Close Contact- If identified as a close contact, remain quarantined at home for 14 days for symptom monitoring and/or testing. Other Precautions- School, workplace or other facilities where a confirmed case has been present may need to notify students, staff, and families. [ALPHANUMERICID] RECOMMENDED SUPPLEMENTS: Vitamin C 1000 mg per/day- Ascorbic acid has many biological properties that can help the body fight viruses and bacteria. Zinc 75-110 mg/day- It is believed that zinc blocks genetic replication which can slow the spread of viruses. Zinc lozenges are preferred. Vitamin D3 1000-4000 IU per/day- Vitamin D has very powerful immune boosting properties. Vitamin D levels begin to drop in older person especially during the winter months. Melatonin (slow release) 0.3 mg increase as tolerated to 1-2 mg/night- Melatonin is a strong anti-oxidant which may slow viral reproduction. People over 40 ten to have lower levels of melatonin, Quercetin 250-500 mg/ two times per day- Quercetin comes from plants and is believed to be a very potent antiviral chemical."
